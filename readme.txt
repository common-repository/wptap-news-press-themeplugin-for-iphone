== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need WPtap?

As we know, due to the difference in screen size between an iPhone and a PC, many WordPress sites with regular PC themes failed to translate well in the viewport of a small iPhone. Consequently, those sites look messy and chunky on iPhone, which makes it hard for users to navigate their contents on an iPhone.

iPhone's user interface (UI) is featured by its multi-touch display. Users browse a site by tapping and swiping the screen. However, regular WordPress themes are not designed to optimize iPhone's unique user experience, thus not so friendly to iPhone users at all.

Most WordPress sites make heavy use of different javascripts which significantly increase the load time of pages on iPhone, and drive your visitors on 3G/EDGE battery.

All of above makes browsing a site on iPhone not fun!

So, to bring fun back, we've built WPtap, a lightweight, iPhone-optimized, feature-rich, and elegant looking ¡°theme application¡±. User can also customize various aspects of his Wordpress site's presentation through the well-designed control panel.

= Well, what if my users don't like it & want to see my regular site?

We've included a built-in option on your site (e.g. at header/footer) for your users to easily switch between the WPtap view and your site's regular appearance. A cookie with the setting choice is saved for future visits.

= Will it slow down my blog?

Absolutely No! WPtap is specially designed for and only for iPhone. Its performance has been optimized based on iPhone's design specs and Safari browser. Our tech team has run through testing to make sure it offers your site's viewers the best viewing experience. The theme package of WPtap is designed to be as lightweight and speedy as possible, while still serving your site's content in a richly presented way sparing no essential features like search, login, categories, pictures, tags and comments.
